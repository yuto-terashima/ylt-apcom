The **Best Presentation Award** was granted for outstanding performance at the **Collaborative Research Idea Hackathon**.  

The presented idea focused on integrating **Finite Element Methods (FEM)** and **Molecular Dynamics (MD)** simulations to explore the mechanical properties of advanced materials. This innovative approach emphasizes the importance of **multi-scale simulations** in bridging fine-scale material behaviors and coarse-scale applications, contributing significantly to computational mechanics.  

The hackathon provided a platform for researchers from various disciplines to collaborate, exchange ideas, and advance cutting-edge research methodologies, demonstrating the value of teamwork in driving scientific innovation.
